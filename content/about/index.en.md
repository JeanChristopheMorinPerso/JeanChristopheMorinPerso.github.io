If you ended up here it's probably because you want to know more about me, so here we go.

I'm a software developer that spent most of its career (so far) in the [VFX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_effects) industry
for a company called [RodeoFX](https://rodeofx.com).
Recently (end of 2020) I joined a software company called [Signiant](https://www.signiant.com).

I am a curious person who likes to solve problems in elegant ways. I'm not afraid of big challenges. I love learning new things
and I'm apparently known to be rarely satisfied with workarounds... I focus a lot on consistency (in code, conventions, etc).

# My professional story :book:

I've studied 3D Animation thinking I'd become an artist. I always loved computers, technology in general and
movies. One year into my study, I got annoyed by the lack of
automations and tools provided by 2D/3D softwares. These annoyances led me to learn Python on the side,
not too sure where it would lead me or where I would end up. So for the rest (2 years) of the program
I slowly progressed and learned a lot of things. It was the hard way of learning mostly, which means
no teachers to help me (as the program wasn't including programming courses and the college was quite small,
so limited resources). I was lucky enough to have supportive teachers though.

Before the last semester, I found a full time job at [Mikros Animation](https://www.mikrosimage-animation.com/en/) in Montreal to work
on [The Little Prince](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1754656/). About at the same time where I accepted the job,
my school program manager told me RodeoFX was searching for a
[Pipeline TD](https://www.screenskills.com/starting-your-career/job-profiles/visual-effects-vfx/technical/pipeline-technical-director-td/)
in their Quebec city studio.
This was an intership of 1 month with possibility of a job offer at the end).
Not afraid of challenges, I also accepted this job. And I was also not afraid of solving problems.... Because I just accepted
two jobs in two not so close different cities. I got lucky in all this. The Little Prince was near the end when I joined
the project in late December and RodeoFX was only ready to welcome me at the start of February.

So I started at Mikros, worked there for a little bit more than a month, resigned and started my intership at RodeoFX. I rocked
my intership, got hired full time and worked for RodeoFX for almost 6 years.

Through these years there, I worked with great
people, developers, engineers, ITs, DevOPs that teached me plenty of fundamental things.
RodeoFX gave me a huge playground. They trusted me, they've let me take on huge challenges and projects, allowed
me to travel quite frequently to their different studios.

I dedicated all my energy into the job.
Spent days, nights and week-ends entirely focused on software development, learning new technologies, trying new things,
reading a lot, etc. Not the healthiest way to succeed, but it's one way :slightly_smiling_face:. I always believed
(and still am) that if you
work hard and smart enough, it normally pays off.
